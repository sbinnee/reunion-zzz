# STT meeting
Typical process of makeing a meeting note.

1. Record audio
2. Transcribe (Use `transcribe_meeting.py` covers it)
3. Review (I do it. It takes max 10m. Not bad, I think.)
    - Diarization
    - Sectioning
4. LLM to summarize (TODO)
    For now, I just copy-paste the whole content in chat UI.


# TODO
https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text
- Try out auto diarization
- Try out speaker refs
